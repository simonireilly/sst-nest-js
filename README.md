# SST with NestJS

Composition of NestJS standalone with Vendia Serverless Express for demonstrating strong conventions applied to serverless applications.

## Justification

Often we want to use the cool new tools, but we also need to go fast, an onboard developers into our team.

By using a framework with strong conventions we can rely on its documentation, tutorials and community to enable our team to be onboarded quickly.

Additionally we avoid some duplicated effort for undifferentiated heavy lifting such as:

- Implementing our own patterns for Model, View, Controller
- Implementing our own patterns for Data Access processes
- Implementing custom solutions for documentation
- Implementing our own build, compile, preview and ship processes

These wins go hand in hand with the idea that we can also have a portable application, and more specifically, a composable application.

One which we can compose into a local dev server, and also compose into a remote serverless deploy.

This is one of the main advantages that NestJS brings to the table.
